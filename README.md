## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>
<br>

- **Ruby on Rails (Back End):** The powerful Rails framework forms the backbone of our project, seamlessly managing data operations and ensuring a robust server-side architecture. [Back-End Repository](https://github.com/firepicaso/camera-rental-backend.git)

- **Front-End UI Repository:** Explore the dynamic user interface crafted for an intuitive experience. [Front-End Repository](https://github.com/prg-04/camera-rental-frontend.git)
<br>

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

<br>


- **Front end Functionality**
Our front-end seamlessly retrieves information from the Ruby on Rails (ROR) system, offering a user-friendly interface. Users effortlessly explore camera options, access detailed information, and book rentals for streamlined and efficient management.

- **Designed for admin use** In parallel, administrators hold the authority to oversee and manage new camera listings, update existing camera details, monitor all reservations, and execute changes or cancellations. This elevated functionality surpasses the options available to regular customers.
